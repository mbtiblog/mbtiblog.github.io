You are likely sensitive to conflict and criticism, and you may have difficulty with rigid hierarchies and strict rules. However, you are also creative, empathetic, and open-minded, which can be valuable assets in the workplace.</p><p>One strategy for navigating the workplace as an INFP is to seek out roles that allow you to use your strengths, such as counseling, human resources, or writing. You may also want to consider working for a company that values creativity and teamwork, rather than one that prioritizes competitiveness and individual achievement.</p><p>It can also be helpful to establish a support system at work. Seek out colleagues who share your values and with whom you can connect. This can help you to feel more comfortable and confident in your work environment.</p><p>It's also important to be aware of your own needs and to set boundaries to protect yourself from burnout. This may include taking regular breaks, setting aside time for self-care, and learning to say no when necessary.</p><p>Overall, as an INFP, you have many valuable qualities that can make you a valuable asset in the workplace. It's important to find a work environment that allows you to be true to yourself, and to take care of yourself to maintain your well-being.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 28, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://nwnsec.github.io/authors/nwn/" class="invert" rel="author">nwn</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Sed varius enim lorem ullamcorper dolore aliquam aenean ornare velit lacus,ac varius enim lorem ullamcorper dolore.
